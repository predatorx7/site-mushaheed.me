Heya readers! This is my first blog post!

Let me start with my introduction. 

My name is Mushaheed. I'm a software developer, and an open-source enthusiast. I love space, programming, gaming, clouds watching, and cats! My favorite genres are sci-fi, mystery, thrillers, and fantasy. 

As a developer, before starting my career, bad software products would always distress me. And so I picked up the sword of programming with my blazing motivation to create beautiful, and easy to use experiences for users and awesome tools to make everyone more productive. I want to contribute in the work which can help someone generate more value for themselves, & others. 

This is my new blog site where I'll share my experiences and discoveries from my journey of life. So lets start mining for brilliant diamonds along the way. And by diamonds I mean "the value and knowledge we'll gain together". Or maybe it is "the awesome stuff that we'll share with everyone from our work"? Either way, you'll have fun.
